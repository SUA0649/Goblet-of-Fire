# Goblet of Fire

## Overview
Goblet of Fire is a 2D game project aimed at developing an engaging and extensible gaming experience for our Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. Our objective is to create a game that showcases our proficiency in OOP principles and design patterns while providing an enjoyable gameplay experience.

## Project Concept
"Goblet of Fire" is a 2D fighting game where players control characters armed with guns and equipped with unique abilities. Set in dynamically changing environments inspired by the Harry Potter universe, players engage in fast-paced battles on single-keyboard controls.

## Objectives
- Develop an accessible, engaging, and extensible 2D fighting game experience.
- Implement unique character abilities, weapon systems, and environmental hazards.
- Showcase proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming principles and design patterns.
- Create a polished final product for presentation and submission.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: C++
- Graphics Library: SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)
- Development Environment: Visual Studio 2022 Community
- Version Control: Git and GitHub

## Key Features
- Unique Character Abilities: Each character may possess one ultimate ability or one tactical ability, or maybe both, providing diverse gameplay options.
- Dynamic Maps: Maps feature environmental hazards such as lava showers and gusts of wind, affecting gameplay dynamics.
- Weapon Customization: Players can customize their arsenal with different gun types and attachments. 

## Project Scope
- Core Gameplay Mechanics: Implement player movement, character abilities, weapon systems, and environmental effects.
- UI/UX Design: Design intuitive user interfaces for menus, character selection, and in-game HUD.
- Sound and Music: Incorporate sound effects and background music to enhance the gaming experience.
- Testing and Debugging: Conduct thorough testing to ensure gameplay balance, performance, and stability.

## Coding Standards and Guidelines
Adherence to Google coding style, conventions, best practices, and guidelines, ensuring consistent and readable code. Code reviews and peer programming sessions to be conducted to maintain code quality.

## Project Deliverables
- Source Code: Complete codebase with well-structured and documented C++ files. Files will be distributed in different directories, depending on their usage category. 
- Documentation: Project report detailing game design, development process, and technical specifications. In-line comments to be used to document code functionality and usage. 
- Executable Build: Packaged game executable along with `.dll` files for external libraries.

## Communication Channels
- Regular Team Meetings: Weekly meetings on every Tuesday and Friday to discuss progress, challenges, and next steps. 
- Communication Platform: Utilize WhatsApp for day-to-day communication and collaboration.
- Version Control: Use Git and GitHub for managing codebase and tracking changes.

## Milestones
1. Input taking/handling interface
2. Character Classes (status, decorator, component)
3. Game Physics (movements, jumps, collisions, attacks)
4. Graphical components

## Tasks and Responsibilities
To be decided in the team meeting on 12.04.2024.
